# sqerl #

This is a modified version of sqerl from opscode that does not include any pooling application.

I have removed mysql support for the time being.

opscode's sqerl is available at https://github.com/opscode/sqerl

I tried adhering to the Apache license but have no idea how I should have changed the files. If you have any comments please to let me know.
